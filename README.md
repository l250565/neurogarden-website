NeuroGarden Website - HTML/CSS Assignment

Seed and Design Rationale

Seed Concept:
I created NeuroGarden as a fictional company that combines plants with computer technology. The idea came from thinking about how nature and technology could work together. I designed three smart plants: Orchid CPU for computing, Fern Firewall for security, and Moss Memory for data storage.

Design Rationale:
- Used purple and blue colors to make it look modern and tech-related
- Made the layout simple and easy to use on phones and computers
- Used CSS Grid to arrange the plant cards neatly
- Created custom form elements that look better than basic browser styles
- Made sure the website works on different screen sizes

Validation Proof

HTML Validation
I validated my HTML code using the W3C Markup Validation Service and received no errors. The HTML follows semantic standards and proper structure.

CSS Validation
